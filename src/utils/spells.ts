Fetishes work like an Imbued Items, save that a fetish is powered by Essence and, instead of holding a Supernal spell, it holds one of the bound ghost’s Influences and, possibly, some of its Numina.\nCreating a fetish requires that the spell have one Potency per dot of Influence the object will possess, plus one Potency per Numen. A fetish doesn’t have to host all of the ghost’s abilities. Activating the powers within the fetish is an instant action and uses the ghost’s dice pool.\nThe fetish has its slumbering ghost’s Essence pool and can recharge Essence when near one of the ghost’s Anchors. It also recharges Essence when the ghost contained within is remembered by the living. The fetish’s user can pay Essence out of the fetish’s pool to power its abilities. If the bound ghost ever acquires Essence equal to its Corpus, however, the spell ends immediately.\nTriggering the bound ghost’s Ban or Bane immediately destroys the fetish.\n',

They cannot even master enough attention to process their allies' words or focus on anything else in combat, although they can still apply Defense. They also have a natural sense of the fate threads to follow in order to get to the focus of their attention, causing some to drop everything just to make their way to them.\nThis makes it an invaluable way to draw aggression to highly fortified targets or enable flanking attacks. In social circles, it's a great way to bring the focus of the key players to the mage, providing a way to create connections even amidst the busiest locales.\nWithout additional scale factors, the caster is the center of attention.\n",

      "In the Dread Domain of Horkus, Greek god of oaths, promises have a naturally binding power. This channels the Old Laws of the Domain to oversee a blood oath. It creates a small round metal, coin looking object indicating the debt of a blood oath between two individuals. Opening in the middle to reveal a divided surface, there also exists a small button on the side that makes a small needle pop up from the top. The debtor presses bloody thumbprint on one side of the divided surface to commit an oath is owed, while the debtee likewise presses their bloody thumb to the other side to indicate when an oath has been fulfilled. Its surface bears the latin words Quod Debitum Sanguine and the image of a skull.\nOaths can be left open (whoever holds the marker can call on it) or be keyed to only work for certain owners. It can also be left open for third parties to use. The coin is known to shift its images to show what the oath entails.\nOnce created, the spell safely relinquishes the Marker with no additional costs. Without Death 5, it normally requires the caster to be within the Dread Domain to create it. There is an exception, any of the two coins that a ghost carries can be made into one. The oath it holds, once signed, must be fulfilled before the spell's Duration expires (or before the oath's agreed time limit). If the marker was never signed before then, either it returns to normal (if made of the coin) or crumbles into ashes (if made in the Domain), with no further consequences. One that was signed and expired is considered to be unfulfilled.\nA Marker signed is registered by the Kerberos and enforced by its agents. While a blood oath must still be willingly signed, the Kerberos sees that it is carried through. Those that do not follow through with their oaths can expect a visit from its agents, the orkus. They seek to manipulate both sides to follow through or, should there be a breach of the oath, they mediate for compensation to be agreed upon.\nOathbreakers that refuse this offer receive much more serious consequences, for the Kerberos calls upon its own ancient oaths to bestow the Mantle of the Domain upon the Wild Hunt. Thus empowered, the Furies are set forth to inflict an appropriate karmic retribution upon them.\nThose that make multiple or especially egregious transgressions can expect the visit of a Keeper called Zeus Horkos. What happens to those that survive its trials is the stuff of legends, some whisper it grants an Attainment that makes manipulating oaths simpler (rote property on Clash of Wills involving them by spending a mana), others speak of them receiving an Artifact that can sever any oath and some rumors say they receive a copy of Horkus' ledger, where every oath is recorded.\nWhatever the case, it's a popular rote with Arrows, as it's considered a valuable teaching tool for a key corollary: Promise Only What You Would Have Others Promise in Your Place.\n",

The subject of this spell gains up to Potency dots in a Social Merit of the mage's choosing for the spell's duration.

Fate conspires to bring the bounty to the subject as expediently as possible.\nCaveat emptor: Although this spell can grant a subject great power and prestige in the Fallen World, it does not confer any ability to use such power effectively. One might become the CEO of a corporation without a lick of knowledge of finance or business politics, which could spell ruin in the long run. Such lead-crowned monarchs rely heavily on delegation and can often be sussed out by the ring of advisors, viziers, and lackeys with which they surround themselves to keep their holding running smoothly. Furthermore, attempting to hijack the upper echelons of Sleeper governance is difficult, and generally ill-advised; our world's presidents, queens, popes, emperors, and firsts among equals are watched very carefully from myriad shadowed corners. On more than one occasion the unwise casting of this spell has led to the manifestation of an Ananke or worse, an Exarchal Ochema, to set things back to the way they were.\n",

In combat, the subject performs the action on their Initiative count. The subject must be capable of performing the action, though the realm of possibility should be interpreted widely here: A given window might not normally be able to open on its own, but the magic of the spell arranges events so that it does so this one time, for instance. In the same way, a subject can be made to reveal a fact that they might not otherwise consciously know, although they must still have some potential for knowing such.\nThe stated condition and outcome must be more or less comparable in probability: The mage speaking a word to make a dog bark, the subject winning a claw game to find a fifty-dollar bill, a meteor strike causing the subject to suffer a stroke.\nThis spell cannot kill a target without qualification, but any hazards introduced affect the subject as they normally would. Alternatively, this spell can function as an attack, dealing Potency in the mage\'s choice of bashing or lethal damage when the condition comes to pass, or instead impose a predesigned Hex or Boon on the subject.\n',

The caster must also set a default resolution for when the spell ends, but it can be changed reflexively while he retains spell control.\nTargets cannot move, do not require food or sleep, do not age or suffer wounds. Can they perceive anything in that state ? Yes and no, most Mind mages who look into the answer find it hard to explain. Without conjunctional Mind 2, the harrowing experience provokes a breaking point when the spell ends.\n',

      "Supernal magic is wondrous and incredibly adaptable, however, only a foolish mage would dismiss it as the only type of willworking. Occultists and religious figures have developed rituals to harness the inherent supernatural powers of existence, refining them over the course of millennia into a form accessible to anyone. Some of the most potent ones leverage the symbolism of death to create powerful effects. This spell was created to furnish a mage with knowledge of these practices without spending extensive amounts of time learning them.\nThis grants a target [Potency] dots of Ceremonies for the duration. Trespassing cabals that were confident in their dispellers were turned away as the Black Cat's Crossing sapped the will of those uninvited to the Sanctum. The Lover's Telephone allows for reliable communication even in areas where sympathetic magic is warded and Death Watch has proven invaluable in keeping injured cabalmates alive until a healer can be found.\n",

This rote allows the mage to quickly assume the destiny of the role, strengthening and reshaping it to suit their needs.\nWhen cast upon an Awakened subject, it grants them [Potency] dots in Shadow Name, with the caster choosing its purview and symbolic correspondences. Should the subject already possess one, its power increases by [Potency] dots, with the caster being able to add or alter its symbolism as they wish.\nWhen cast upon multiple subjects, Potency may instead be allocated to grant a Cabal Theme of the caster's design. The merits can go above normal limits.\nWith conjunctional Mind 1, the subject can be granted the Shadow Self merit as well.\n",

      "A sinister spell that obliterates the target's sense of self completely. It annihilates all temporal sympathy they have, alongside their Aspirations and Obsessions. Their past, their bonds, the very light of purpose. None of them will have any meaning and they won't even care. Soon their personal history will be forgotten by the world as the target's memories grow hazy themselves.\nThe soul will naturally seek to fill this hollow, prompting them to redefine themselves, to seek new goals, building new Aspirations and Obsessions from scratch. This leaves the subject in a very vulnerable state, a fact that Seers and other Left-Handed magi who favor this rote count on.\nIts origins are murky at best. Some say it was developed by a Minister of Unity. Seers tend to become Enraptured more often, some say this was created to rehabilitate them by forcing them to rebuild Wisdom. Whether they managed or not was irrelevant, for a sagacious Seer knows they would either end up with the power of a new minion or the raw might of a magical savant in their pocket. Others say it was made as a way to tribute one of their enemy's identities to the Tyrant. Whatever the case, the subject turned on their new master and eliminated them.\nAnother theory says the first subject was a covert Sleepwalker agent of Geryon, whose slate was wiped clean between assignments. In the midst of one they heard the call of the Watchtower of Fallen Blood and set about wiping all servants of the Exarchs to avenge their usurped bloodline.\nA third hypothesis holds that it was used by a Nameless Order of mages to hunt a monstrous amalgamation of a True Fae and an Acamoth, manipulating themselves to fight its shards, for only a magus without a True Name can banish them.\nSome think it was an Awakened Doomed to always fall into the Ocean of Fragments. Each time emerging with a new identity stitched together from the random memories drifting in the water and the Admiral's surprising aid (some even speculate the mage is his son reincarnated)\nDozens of these theories exist, each extracted from different corpses of supernatural beings around the world. Each being used akin to a memory tablet, perhaps a diary or a confession. The only thing they all had in common was that they were inscribed with this rote and the message \"I am the Hollow Man, I am the Hollow Man. Many times have I died, many times risen again\".\n",

The limits of Dedication remain in place. The caster can add a new Dedicated tool, overwrite or remove the power of an existing one. This is a Lasting effect and any tools that lose Dedication are simply left with an imprint of the subject's Signature Nimbus.\nThis rote was created out of necessity by a Mystagogue. In order to catch a plunderer of their Sanctum, first they created a scrying window, managing to get just enough power to view the thief. After a remote cast, the scoundrel would find themselves deprived of their Dedicated tool, all the while the Mystagogue held their two new ones in hand. The mage found the ability to bypass all sympathetic Withstands on the thief endlessly helpful when securing compensation.\n",

Naturally, these Seers see none more worthy than themselves and so created this rote to secure a stranglehold over power.\nThis creates a disease of [Potency] severity. To mundane science it is a persistent, far spreading, yet ultimately harmless symbiotic organism. Those attuned to such things know better, for it is a parasite that corrupts their very luck.\nThose unable to resist it are subject to two effects. First is that they eventually experience a twist of fortune that sets them to Aspire to serve the caster faithfully. Second is that no matter how badly they fail at this or how often others sabotage them, they are Doomed to push the caster's agenda forward.\nIt is said the Oracle of Delphos used to have this spell active in the incense used for divination, binding the fate of heroes to the Prophet's dictates.\nThe use of this spell is not done without a great deal of preparation, masquerading the effect so as to cast the blame on misfortune spirits, beings of the Hedge or rival Ministries. Should the truth be discovered before the Ministry seizes the city, it would be prudent to flee quickly, rather than face the endless creativity of an entire city of Awakened with a vendetta.\n",

The mage can choose between: gravity, weak interaction (radiation decay), and electromagnetism (but only one form of electromagnetism). While this spell allows you to manipulate Forces that are covered by other Initiate and Apprentice level spells, this spell is more focused on the shape of these fields. Wanting to increase or decrease the strength of any of these forces requires a different spell.\nThe interaction chosen determines the effect of the spell. For example:\n- Gravity: Replicates the Control Gravity spell;\n- Radiation: Bend radiation to shape an Extreme Environment or block radio transmission.\n- Magnetism: Shape a magnetic field to only affect a certain space.\nParticularly intricate shapes may require a reflexive Wits + Science rolls, at the Storyteller’s discretion.\n',

It would become feared as a tool the Ungula Draconis wields with one objective alone: the absolute annihilation of their opponents.\nThis creates acid rain in an area with suitable atmospheric conditions. This comes into effect within minutes and imposes the Heavy Rain tilt with [Potency] severity, up to a maximum of 4. The water and acid are perfected, making them able to instantly corrode and dissolve anything in the area not made of Perfected materials. Flesh and bone melt before terrified targets, marvels of engineering are unmade and the very landscape is reduced to nothing more than a crater filled with a highly combustible sludge.\nWhen these waters of oblivions have done their work, it is customary to call a lightning strike upon them. This sets off the perfected acid, creating an explosion of [Potency] intensity. It's a final honor playing on the Orders's symbolism as the hand that grasps lightning, a funeral pyre sending off their opponents.\nWhen the duration ends, the acid rain loses its perfected state and the downpour stops. Due to the enormous potential for collateral damage, additional spellwork is usually done to isolate the affected area or guide the waters.\nIt is said entire spirit courts have been swept by them, armies of the walking dead silenced and factories of techno horrors destroyed. Therefore, to be granted this rote is a symbol of the Order's great trust in the mage.\n",

      '"Want to summon a powerful being from the Supernal ? There is an app for that". This has been the tagline technomancers of the Free Council use to promote this rote. By transmitting summoning rituals via electronic data (often heavily protected by magical passwords), they have made it possible for others to quickly and conveniently access the powers and insights not native to their Watchtower\'s Supernal Realm.\nBy having the burden of summoning be done by someone else, this allows less experienced mages to engage in more ambitious experiments or execute grander acts against the followers of the Lie.\nVeteran casters see it as another way to gain revenue or major boons for their own projects. Reactions vary for each Order, but Guardians tend to look at this rote in sheer horror of the potential misuse, especially since anyone can use them (changelings, deviants, Sleepwalkers, etc) and it allows the inexperienced to meddle with forces they cannot begin to comprehend. Arrows tend to see it as a potent new addition to their toolkit.\nThis spell is cast upon a mage. The next time they summon a Supernal Entity, they may spend a mana to store the ritual as electronic data within an electronic device in sensory range. It can be used and transmitted like any app, with the device holding it acting as the summoning circle. The burden of entreating the Entity lies entirely with the user, yet the app\'s interface can be used to end the summoning. If the duration expires before it is used, so does the summoning.\n',

      "The Mage alters the functionality of the target's biological patterning, ensuring that while all normal biological functions are performed as normal, cells replicate perfectly, avoiding the ravaging effects of time, and ensuring that the biological aging process is halted. The practical upshot of this is that while the Mage's body otherwise functions exactly as it normally would, she does not biologically age. This will not halt the effects of cancers, diseases, poisons or other maladies of the form, nor will it stop the psychological effects of aging, however it will work to counteract certain mental afflictions with a physical aspect, such as dementia.\nThis spell is a quick and easy, albeit risky way to embrace the path of Lichdom. Its use is not considered quite as inherently threatening as the other forms of Lichdom, due to their inherently inhuman nature. However it is seen as something of a gateway-spell to those later paths, as the Mage grows older and starts to obsess over the threat of untimely death. As such, while some merely use it to enhance their quality of life for as long as reasonable, you can never truly trust them not to start body snatching or resorting to more permanent, and less dispellable methods. What's more, should the spell be dispelled, the cumulative weight of all of those years of time come crashing down upon the Mage.\nFor this reason, some Mage have developed their own Legacies based on this spell, to avoid such eventualities. Such Mages are almost uniformly declared as Liches. This does not however stop them from accumulating small cults of worshippers, enchanted by the possibility of eternal life, willing to bind themselves forever to the desires of their Master, only to later realize that he could render them crippled or dead with but a thought, as he removes his blessing.\n",

The minds of the subjects fuse together forming a new merged personality with access to all the memories, knowledge and Skills of the subjects. The mage may determine which Attributes and appropriate Merits the being inherits. No Attribute can be higher than the highest level of that Attribute found among the subjects.\nIf the subjects are all of the same supernatural template, then this template remains preserved after the fusion. The mage must determine what abilities the fused being has, again, no ability can be higher than the highest among the subjects. If the subjects are of differing templates then the mage determines which one template the fused being becomes, only the abilities specific to that template can be inherited.\nA mage can only have so many spells active, when fusing mages determine which spells will be under the new entity's spell control.\nOnce the Duration ends the subjects return to normal and any damage sustained is split equally among all subjects regardless of how much damage they had before. Willpower values are unchanged from their pre-merger values.\nMemories of the time spent fused will seem distant and hazy, dreamlike, but the subjects will remember the experience to some degree.\n",

      'Carrying resources as one explores the Tapestry can be cumbersome. Tass can take just about any form, not always a portable or discrete one. Meanwhile, mana batteries can take a long time to replenish. In order to address this issue and inspired by tales of spirit stones that house potent Chi, this rote was developed by a cabal of Nameless students of the Dao of Alchemy.\nWhen cast upon tass or a living being, it transforms them into a crystalline form halfway between the platonic ideals of a living being and a mana battery. It does not require food, water, air or rest. But it can still use normal healing time to "self repair". The user can spend an action to scour their Pattern once a day, transferring the mana either to themselves or the battery, with any excess being lost. They also have a mana capacity of [Potency]. Pigs, rats and fishes made for popular materials.\nIt would only be later that a Left Handed mage would discover one of its more distressing properties. When transforming a mage, their mana capacity is added to the battery. Furthermore, they can be scoured as many times as the target\'s Gnosis allows.\nTargets are still aware of the world around them. Normally this isn\'t an issue, but mages are still capable of casting while transformed. Because of this, additional spellwork is normally employed to "alchemically refine the will into a suitable form". A few Banishers have been known to use them to build up their arsenal of weapons and defenses.\nSome whisper that this rote was developed in parallel in Europe. Mysterium scholars suspect that the famous Philosopher\'s Stone of Nicholas Flamel might be an immortal jade, some even accuse Paris\' mythical immortal of being a thaumavoric lich that remains active to this day.\n',

Potency can be allocated on a one to one basis to increase the number each spawn per day or the amount of mana each is worth. It takes a day after they are planted before they store enough energy to act as tass, attaining their full capacity (they are treated as zero mana tass once created).\nIt is also highly nutritious, each providing the nourishment of a full meal. Their flavor is so exquisite and the consumption gives such a feeling of wellness that it grants the Addicted condition to any who partake, even when no other physically debilitating effect happens.\nThis rote was first invented by the Geryon Ministry, who cultivated entire gardens of "the lotuses from the Nemesis\' palace" to trap Sleepers and Awakened alike in cages of content ignorance. This lotus eater cattle would be all too happy to be harvested by vampires or experimented upon by the Pylons.\nEven those who were rescued tended to seek out the Seers once more, betraying anyone or sacrificing anything to experience its wonders once more.\nThus did the Arrow and Guardians seal this rote in the Censorea, despite it containing no magical taint. But a few abandoned Sanctums of the fallen Ministry may hold a Grimmoire containing it or the journal notes of past Seers may recall it. Maybe the tides of Pancryptia are waiting for just the right time, to part before a devotee of the Nemesis with something to prove.

You can wear armor and weapons in this way, and nobody will notice unless you go through a scanner or be searched physically.\n",

      "Calling on the legendary power of the Gorgons, the Mage turns flesh to stone with their terrible gaze. The target turns into a statue of themselves, with Structure and Durability as appropriate for a solid stone object of their size and composition (marble is very different from granite, for example).\nTargets turned to stone are not dead, but they aren't 'alive' either; the target is rendered unconscious and unaware for the Duration of the spell, during which they do not age or hunger. If the statue is damaged in any way, the target receives comparative wounds when turned back to flesh, but is otherwise unaware of any harm done to them. If the damage is repaired before this time, no harm occurs. If sufficient damage is dealt to reduce the statue to Structure 0, the target dies, and reconstructing the statue does nothing to restore them.\nPetrified targets, despite their quiescent state, can be communicated with. Mind spells that allow the reading of minds or telepathic contact can interact with the victim as they would any mortal. The target experiences this as a panicked, dream-like state, though sufficient communications in this manner may allow them to become aware of their situation. If they have any magical abilities, such powers are available to them in these moments.\n",

      "A general purpose spell for archeomancers, which allows them to understand the symbolic meaning of objects they find. This can be used to understand things like designations of sacred sites (such as shimenawa or torii gates), the meaning/intent of paintings and frescos, the purpose of a tradition (such as warding off ghosts by leaving a lit candle on the porch on moonless nights), social queues, luck glyphs, warding runes, tapestries and more (although translation is beyond its scope). It's often used when exploring ruins, Emanations or Sanctums of very ancient mages. However, certain Silver Ladder diplomats also rely on it to help establish a baseline of etiquette when amongst unfamiliar cultures.\nWhen analyzing Abyssal symbols, the Mind variation of this spell produces a jumbled mess of contradicting and nonsense explanations, but can identify dangerous memetic or similar phenomena. The Prime version simply identifies the taint and its key triggers, but cannot analyze more than that. Utilizing both Arcana allows for a concise and accurate study of the symbol, or at least as far as a mortal mind can safely parse.\nWhen cast using Mind 3, it can be used to analyze any memory containing symbols or the symbolism of a dream the subject has experienced (this variation can be Withstood via Resolve).\n",

Rather they understand how to optimize logistics, coordinate their allies and plan grand strategies, maximizing the efficiency of their spellwork. This rote was invented to hone the strategist's craft to sublime heights.\nIt elevates the subject's ability to plan and strategize, granting an additional [Potency] dice to any rolls for creating plans, capped by trait limits. However, developing plans as a team requires all participants to be under its effect.\nIn addition, it also fosters focus and a methodical approach. Should time be plentiful and the subject chooses to build a plan as an extended action, it increases the number of rolls that can be made by [Potency].\n",

      "A cabal's Demesne is where they are at their strongest, allowing them to prepare and experiment extensively, unhindered by the Lie. The easiest way to combat them is with a well warded Sleeper shock troop, but this is normally loud and messy. A cabal going in unaware risks a very deadly encounter. In order to provide a more tactically sound approach, the Arrow have devised this as a way to usurp control of these magical bunkers.\nWhen cast upon all the soul stones creating a Demesne or within the entire area they are in, it allows them to specify the conditions necessary to access its benefits. The caster may specify up [Potency] conditions necessary to receive the benefit, as well as whether some or all need to be fulfilled in order to qualify. Possible conditions include being of a certain Path, specific Nimbus signatures, Legacies, Shadow Name, yantra type or theme (including Cabal Theme) .\nSeers are fond of setting specific yantras as Keys, using this to tempt invading Pentacle mages to use their patron's symbols. A few others prefer to use it as a political statement, forcing visiting Pylons to pay homage to their Exarchs.\nWhenever facing highly defended Sanctums, this spell is usually utilized as part of the opening salvo. While the mages inside deal with containing spells that suddenly risk Paradox and summons being corroded by Fallen exposure, the edge of the battle can be seized.\nThere have even been cabals that use temporal pockets alongside this spell to create, on the fly, Demesnes only they can use, rapidly overwhelming the opposition.\n",

It does not matter whether the deception is supernatural or mundane, innocuous or malicious, though it cannot change the basic form that the lie takes. For example, if the subject of the spell has dyed hair, the Mage could change the color of the subject's hair to any other color, but could not change the subject's hair into a duck. Forged documents could be rewritten to give different (equally false) information, but must concern the same basic subject matter. If the subject of the spell is an illusion of supernatural origin, and the Mage succeeds in a Clash of Wills against the owner of the effect, they can modify details of the illusion (e.g. change an illusory person to look like a different person) but cannot change the illusion's basic form.\nThe only known Rote of this spell is befouled.

It can be used to pass a consequential deception off as a trivial one, or to send an opponent on a wild goose chase by convincing them that something which is true is actually a lie.\n',

      'Resonance forms the backbone of much of the supernatural of the Fallen World. Moreover, Resonance subtly affects the Fallen World, attempting to reinforce its theme, even without spiritual activity. This spell enhances the potency of Resonance, causing its self reinforcing nature to overgrow. If possible, examples of the theme will flock to the subject. Characters exposed to the Cascade will find conversation and thoughts turning towards the Theme. Those making decisions will choose towards promoting the theme significantly more often. Prolonged exposure tends to cause Intrusive thoughts, even after the exposure stops, and Long Term exposure possibly alters Aspirations and Obsessions into promoting and spreading the Resonance Theme.\nMages can use the Resonance of a Cascade as a +2 yantra to spells relating to the Resonance.\nAll This is without the influence of ephemeral entities, who are often driven to a frenzy by the cascade. Those entities benefiting from the resonant condition gain Potency more essence from staying near the Resonance, and Spirits may add Potency to rolls to feed off the Resonance, even through the Gauntlet.\nNote: This spell was inspired by a line on pg 241 which states that ley line resonance of violence increases the murder rate. I wanted the spell not to actually affect the physical word without some reach. If you want a different version of the spell that does affect the physical, the spell would be a weaving that works like a nimbus by increasing dice rolls relating to the theme and penalizing rolls opposed to the theme.\n',

Consilia with a lesser care for tradition or with more resilient foes tend to favor using it on a simple, yet effective tool: bundles of dynamite.\nThis enchants a weapon so that it is able to cut through magic, applying its damage modifier as the potency of a Supernal Dispellation, which suppresses the spell for the duration. The user must actively attack the source of the magic to do so.\nWhen cutting through AoE spells, an attack in any point of it will do, but this spell must have the appropriate Scale factor to affect it.\n",

The subject has no physical presence, even in Twilight- she is actually not anywhere in particular. She exists only within her Name, and can only interact with the world by means of spells like Scrying. This is an incredibly disturbing experience for subjects who cannot use remote spellcasting, akin to absolute sensory deprivation.\nProlonged exposure to this spell (more than an hour per dot of the subject’s Composure) may provoke breaking points or adverse Conditions like Shaken or Spooked. This spell cannot be used on subjects that, for whatever reason, lack a Sympathetic Name. If the subject loses her Sympathetic Name while the spell is active, the spell's Duration ends immediately.\nThe subject retains all her Attributes and Skills, but may not take any Physical actions, including oblations or using yantras that require touch or speech, though she can still cast spells. This usually means that without some means of remote viewing, she may only cast spells on herself, through her Familiar or a soul stone, or on a subject whose Sympathetic Name she concentrates on for one turn. She is immune to attacks or damage, but not supernatural powers that can perceive her, while inhabiting her Sympathetic Name. She can be targeted sympathetically as normal. Mages who wish to remain in their Name for an extended time often use spells like Possession to act in the physical world. When the spell's Duration ends, she returns to the point she disappeared from.\n",

      "Many people are aware of the Banach-Tarski paradox: you can decompose a ball in a certain way into unmeasurable parts and reconstruct two balls from these parts, which are in all ways identical to the original one. This idea inspired you to do the same; however, in your spell these parts are still connected with each other, and every change in one part is causing identical change in another one (any attempts to get rid of this caused Paradox whenever spell Duration ended and two different conditions clashed in one object).\nYour spell creates an identical copy of the subject (or object) in the place you want. Those copies are, in a way, one object - destruction of one will correspond with destruction of another, and so on. Because of that, copy is absolute for all means and purposes. When Duration of the spell ends, the created copy disappears. You can create a copy of a living being, but because you aren't creating two different minds to control two bodies, this leads only to confusion of this being (unless it can multitask naturally or with Mind spell). As with inanimate objects, any change in one 'copy' leads to similar change in another one. With addition of Time you can delay these changes in another copy until the end of spell.\n",

The subject gains an Essence pool appropriate to Rank, though this pool begins empty, and also gains a Ban & a Bane determined by the Storyteller. Subjects must also contend with powerful, alien instincts in the Spirit form. When confronted by circumstances that would trigger a strong instinctive response, such as an opportunity to create or feed on Resonant Essence, she must roll Resistance reflexively to avoid acting on these impulses. Failure means that she gives in to the alien urges until they’re satisfied. Mages add Gnosis to this roll, and other supernatural beings add their own Tolerance Traits.\nPotency may be assigned to increase attributes on a 1:1 basis, or to grant additional Numina, though attributes may not be raised above the individual or total cap for the subject’s new Rank, nor may they be granted more Numina than the maximum for a Spirit of their Rank.\nWhile under the effect of this spell, the subjects may be targeted by any effect that can normally target Spirits, with the exception of Spirit magic, which requires the Life Arcanum added to the casting at an equal level. The subject follows other rules for Ephemeral beings for the Duration, including Discorporation when full of lethal or aggravated damage.\nThe subject retains any supernatural abilities they possess, and all of their skills. They may use the higher of their native Supernatural Tolerance or their Rank to determine Supernatural Tolerance in this form.

The mage cannot gain more Influence dots than what the spirit has.\n- One Numen that the spirit has. The roll to activate the Numen is Gnosis + Spirit and if it costs Essence the mage may opt to use Mana instead. The mage cannot gain more Numen than what the spirit has.\n- One of the mage’s Attribute dots may be boosted by the Attribute dots of the spirit on a 1-1 basis. The spirit’s Power dots can boost Intelligence, Strength and Presence. Finesse dots can boost Wits, Dexterity and Manipulation. Resistance dots can boost Resolve, Stamina and Composure. No Attribute can be boosted beyond the allowed maximum of the Mage.\nThis spell has a slight cosmetic effect as well, depending on what type of spirit is cohabiting the mage’s body. A fire spirit may make the mage smell like smoke and have a slight orange tint to their eyes, while a leech spirit makes the mage much paler than normal.

      "A rote developed as a cross Order research initiative between the Guardians and Arrows, as well as one of the secrets they are most loathe to share with outsiders. By binding the existence of their Imagos to more specific times, they are able to firmly ground them to the Fallen World, allowing for safe relinquishment.\nThe subject may choose up to [Potency] spells under their control. For every spell chosen, the subject may designate up to [Potency] days of the year within which the spell will be bound to. It will only exist during those days and its duration will only be counted within them. A spell with a month-long duration bound to the 4th of August, for example, will only take effect during that day, but this phenomenon will continue to repeat for 30 years. Should it be bound to the 6th of January as well, the spell will last for 15 years instead.\nWithin the given interval, the subject is able to specify temporal conditions as broad or specific as they wish. Within some of the most well guarded Censorea, those that hold world ending threats, it's not uncommon to restrict spells to manifest at specific hours of the chosen day. Some go as far as using formulas to determine which spell will take effect, such as a specific defense only being used in years that are a modulo of two and at hours that are multiples of 7.\nUtilizing this method, layers of interlocking and precisely timed defenses can be created. Intruders attempting to breach these vaults will find wards, puzzles and challenges that are new each time, creating formidable magical fortresses.\n",

      "Perhaps one of the oldest unsolved Mysteries is the Count of Saint Germaine. This legendary occultist has been spotted in multiple European courts and Concilia across the ages, wearing different faces, Nimbus and following different Paths, yet always having a consistent array of lost knowledge, memories and resources no one else should have possessed.\nA few whisper they are mobile carriers of a lost Mysterium Athaneum, waiting for someone to pay the right price for their knowledge. Some say that they are the apprentices of a Guardian Exemplar, creating a Nameless Order that creates Labyrinths for the Threshold Seeking itself. Whatever the truth may be, it is this rote that has allowed multiple mages to assume the role throughout the ages, composing Germaine's current incarnation from a vault of plundered and bartered histories.\nThis spell binds a part of the subject's history to a target item, transferring it entirely to whoever wears it. The caster is able to transfer up to [Potency] dots of skills, merits or parts of the target's life (their family life, career, relationship, criminal past, etc) into the item. Whoever wears the item receives that part of the subject's life. A user can only acquire merits that are compatible with their template.\nWithout additional scale factors, the caster's history is transferred by default. The user acquires all the knowledge, experience, status (or infamy) and physical components associated with the history. A user that takes the knowledge of a master sword fighter might find themselves plagued by occasional pain from a knee injury and taking the Status of a company president might mean potential kidnappers now focus on them.\nWhen the item is not being worn, that history is effectively phased out of the timeline. Depending on the caster's choice, either other people would have performed the actions or they never having happened at all. Memories of the stored time grow hazy and distant to all involved.\nSometimes Saint Germaine has used this rote to claim membership in different Orders. In a few cases, they have joined cabals and helped them build their reputation, only to store their historical contributions to their Sanctum in a trinket, making the cabal unknowingly defend the temporary rewritten site. A few times they have plundered the resources of entire cabals, gaining access to libraries, imbued items and Sanctums that they can call upon on the fly. Indeed some theorize certain stores, office complexes and apartments buildings could be potential highly defended troves of lost knowledge, waiting to be activated by a bauble from Saint Germaine's collection.\nSome even say they have amassed histories dating back hundreds of years, passing on a cornucopia of life pieces from one generation to the next, perhaps explaining the extensive yet often confusing results of investigating the Count with Time magic.\n",

      "When staging a play, it is vital to have understudies ready to assume the main role should the lead become incapacitated. Inspired by those principles, this rote was created to protect mages in the most hostile of scenarios.\nThis spell allows the caster to designate a subject to be the main actor and all others to be understudies. The subjects become temporarily entangled so only one may exist at a time and the active actor becomes their anchor to the present. Once per turn, the main actor can swap places with any of the understudies, who can act freely. Understudies experience this as temporary stuttering from their last stage appearance to the current scene. The main actor is always aware of the sensory input of the understudies and chooses who from the actor pool is active at the time of casting. Should the caster maintain spell control, they can make the swap instead.\nWhenever an understudy dies or breaks, another member of the actor pool of the main actor's choice takes its place. When the spell ends, all actors appear in the nearest space to the active actor.\nSome users apply this spell to their guns, choosing the optimal bullet for every situation. A few others make traps and explosives into their understudies, allowing them to take down a cadre of foes with no risk. Stealth inclined mages infiltrate sanctums by making their foes' friends into understudies, being invited into their Sanctums. Some cabals use it to escort important charges, minimizing risk of exposure while allowing the flexibility to choose the optimal cabalmate to meet each challenge.\nWith conjunctional Fate ••, up to [Potency] keys can be assigned to switch to a specific actor. For a Reach, the keys can be things detectable only by Mage Sight. For a Reach, Potency can be assigned to designate keys that lock the ability to switch the current actor, unlock the ability to switch the current actor or forcibly switch the current actor to a designated one and locks the ability to switch it.\n",

Within its duration, it allows the subject to reflexively perform up to [Potency] actions in addition to the current one, each being taken from a turn in the future. However, this locks them into performing the motions for the action in the next immediate turns. Should the spell's duration run out before they can perform the cause of an action, the effect is undone, a fact which Banishers leverage to break the will of their captives.\nAn enemy could be hit by a gunshot suddenly materializing, but the subject would need to fire the gun in the next turn. Similarly, they could cast a spell that takes up to [Potency] turns to prepare, paying all costs beforehand, then run away the next few turns as they focus on the yantras for that spell. Some even use it to open locks that would require multiple people to act simultaneously. However, this spell does not affect extended actions.\n",

When cast upon a target, the next [Potency] attacks convert all negative change upon them into a temporal aging field that surrounds them. This grants them an extra [Potency] damage on hit (the caster can choose if the attack inflicts lethal or bashing). Furthermore, the isolation from negative change allows attacks to bypass all obstacles that would stop or slow them down, negating Armor Ratings and Durability entirely. Lastly, because loss of momentum and similar changes are arrested, range penalties are negated for the attacks.\nTypically this is cast on a user, allowing all their attacks to benefit from it, but some prefer to place it upon their weapons, reducing flexibility but allowing them to carry more charges.\nSubtle casters might use thrown sand as a weapon, inflicting damage similar to machine gun fire from an otherwise simple distraction tactic. A few others simply "cut" the air with their hands, the dislocated wind creating a slashing effect from which this technique got its nickname. Martial casters may prefer placing it upon themselves, allowing their fists to pierce and tear through obstacles.\n',

Some members of the Silver Ladder claim they were able to use it to intimidate werewolves into thinking they were invincible. There are even Free Council members that used it to survive unharmed after firing themselves via rail gun into space, before proceeding to stay in the vacuum for a few minutes and plunge down into reentry.\nA lesser known secret is that this was recovered alongside with its sister rote, Erosion of Eternity, which  all positive changes on the target (Withstood by Stamina). New positive conditions cannot be imposed and any active ones are suspended, they cannot be healed (they do not recover naturally and mundane medicine does nothing), rest, recover Willpower or regain Mana.

It is the individual's choices that determine which one becomes their new present, while the others are discarded. Inspired by tales of archmages and their powerful subsouls, the Arrow Osterman developed this rote to attain a lesser version of this ability. It allowed him to choose multiple timelines at once and collapse their results into the current one.\nAfter being cast on a subject, it creates [Potency] potential selves, with the same stats, health, skills and any spells cast upon them. Because their history diverges from the point of casting, they are independent beings. However, due to being the same person, cooperation comes naturally.\nThe subject's soul and magical history remains the same. All experience (mundane and arcane) is awarded to the subject. In addition, while each temporal clone can cast spells, they all utilize the same spell control slots. Teamwork spellcasting can also be done at no penalty, but each temporal clone must cast the spell themselves.\nOnce per turn, the subject can reflexively pick another of his potential existences and set it as the present timeline, which moves their consciousness to it. When the spell ends, the subject remains in whatever vessel they were inhabiting.\nWhen the spell ends or the clones die, all of their memories join together in the inhabited vessel, as their timeline is collapsed into it. Should they be dispelled, those memories are not retrieved.\nSimilarly, Acts of Hubris and spending Willpower dots affect all instances. Finally, the clones do not have true souls, merely the temporal potential of the main soul, which is unusable for any purposes (such as sacrificial yantras).\n",

Developed by the Adamant Sage Subutai of the Council of Dragons as a means to reconfigure the battlefield on the fly, this rote has since been employed in myriad stratagems by Talons. Its name is an extension of his view on the Arcanum: "Time is how we frame reality".\nWhen cast upon a mage, it allows them to change an Imago as it enters the Fallen World, rewriting its casting history so that both an area and individual scale were picked at the same time. These spells anchor themselves on the targets, placing them at the center of the area and moving it as they do. This has allowed clever Acanthuses to, for example, create Temporal Stutters that displace lava and volcanic gasses in a bubble around them, allowing them to traverse volcanic craters easily.\nImagos must be deliberately built by the subject to take advantage of this effect and a point of mana must be spent. This effect can affect up to [Potency] spells at a time.\n',
